                <p>Linear algebra is the study of linear combinations. It is the study of vector spaces, lines and planes, and some mappings that are required to perform the linear transformations.  
                    It includes vectors, matrices and linear functions. It is the study of linear sets of equations and its transformation properties.

            <code>
                <p>As we know that linear algebra deals with the study of vector spaces and the linear transformations between them. 
                    By the definition of vector, it is a physical quantity that has both magnitude and direction. 
                    A vector space is defined as the collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied (i.e. scaled) by numbers, called scalars. 
                    Generally, real numbers are taken as scalars, but there exist vector spaces with scalar multiplication 
                    by non-real numbers, i.e. complex numbers, or naturally any field. </p>

                <p>
                    The operations such as vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy specific requirements, called vector axioms. 
                    Generally, the terms real vector space and complex vector space are used to define that the scalars are real or complex numbers, respectively.
                </p>

                <p>Suppose V be any vector space with elements a, b, c and scalars m, n over a field F, then the vector axioms are given by:

                    Commutative of addition: a + b = b + a
                    Associativity of addition: a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
                    Additive identity: a + 0 = 0 + a = a, where 0 is an element in V called zero vector.
                    Additive inverse: a + (-a) + (-a) + a = 0, a, -a belongs to V.
                </p>

                <p>These four axioms define that the vector space V is an abelian group under addition.</p>

                <p>Other axioms include distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition and field addition, identity element of scalar multiplication and so on.</p>

                <p>For example, m(a) = ma; n(a + b) = na + nb</p>

                <p>An element of a specific vector space may have different characteristics. For example, the elements can be a sequence, a function, a polynomial or a matrix. 
                    Linear algebra is affected by those properties of such things that are common or familiar to all vector spaces.</p>

                <p>A linear map can be written for two given vector spaces namely V and W over a field F. This is sometimes referred to as linear transformation or mapping of vector spaces. Thus, it is given by:</p>
                <p>T: V → W

                    This allows us to write the addition of scalar multiplication of elements such as:
                    
                    T(a + b) = T(a) + T(b)
                    
                    T(ma) = mT(a)</p>

            <code>
                <p>A linear function is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and a single independent variable of power 1. 
                    In linear algebra, vectors are taken while forming linear functions. Some of the examples of the kinds of vectors that can be rephrased in terms of the function of vectors.</p>
                <p>Mathematically, linear function is defined as:

                    A function L : Rn → Rm is linear if
                    
                    (i) L(x + y) = L(x) + L(y)
                    
                    (ii) L(αx) = αL(x)

                <p>Matrices are linear functions of a certain kind. 
                    Matrix is the result of organizing information related to 
                    certain linear functions. Matrix almost appears in linear 
                    algebra because it is the central information of linear algebra. </p>
                <p>Mathematically, this relation can be defined as follows.

                    A is an m × n matrix, then we get a linear function L : Rn → Rm by defining
                    
                    L(x) = Ax
                    
                    or 
                    
                    Ax = B

            <code>
                <p>Numerical linear algebra is also known as the applied linear algebra. 
                    Applied linear algebra deals with the study of how matrix operations 
                    can be used to create computer algorithms, which helps to solve the 
                    problems in continuous mathematics with efficiency and accuracy.  
                    In numerical linear algebra, many matrix decomposition methods are 
                    used to find the solutions for common linear algebraic problems like 
                    least-square optimization, locating Eigenvalues, and solving systems 
                    of linear equations. Some of the matrix decomposition methods in 
                    numerical linear algebra include Eigen decomposition, Single value 
                    decomposition, QR factorization and so on.</p>

                        algebraic expression is called principal component analysis.

                        a 2-dimensional screen which is handled only by linear maps which are explained by linear algebra.
